## RT-qSeq
At present there is no suitable technology for performing high throughput analysis the human genome at the mRNA isoform level. RT-qSeq is a newly developed technology that extends the capabilities of state-of-the-art DNA sequencers to enable mRNA scientific investigation at the isoform level. RT-qSeq is a multidisciplinary technology that embodies significant advancements algorithmic, molecular biology, and nextgen sequencing challenges. Herein is contained the software component of RT-qSeq.
